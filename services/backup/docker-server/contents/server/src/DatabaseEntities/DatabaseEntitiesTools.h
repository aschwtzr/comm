 *  backup - backups assigned to users along with the data necessary to decrypt

 *           (for example get me the latest backup, get me backup from some day)
 *        `attachmentHolders` - this is a list of attachment references
 *        `recoveryData` - data serialized with protobuf which is described by
 *           one of the following structures:
 *            { authType: 'password', pakeSecret: string, nonce: string }
 *            { authType: 'wallet', walletAddress: string, rawMessage: string }
 *  log - a single log record
 *        `backupID` - id of the backup that this log is assigned to
 *        `value` - either the value itself(if `persistedInBlob` is false)
 *           or the holder to blob(if `persistedInBlob` is true)
 *        `attachmentHolders` - this is a list of attachment references

/**
 * API - description
 *  CreateNewBackup - This method is called when we want to create a new backup.
 *    We send a new backup key encrypted with the user's password and also the
 *    new compaction. New logs that will be sent from now on will be assigned to
 *    this the compaction of this backup.
 *  SendLog - User sends a new log to the backup service. The log is being
 *    assigned to the latest(or desired) backup's compaction item.
 *  RecoverBackupKey - Pulls data necessary for regenerating the backup key
 *    on the client-side for the latest(or desired) backup
 *  PullBackup - Fetches compaction + all logs assigned to it for the
 *    specified backup(default is the last backup)
